Mr Ong's Lesson
It was not our first lesson in the lab. Mr Ong was teaching us about the first part of ECM and we were doing a practical. We knew Mr Ong only as a lenient teacher who made jokes and quite often, horrible puns. That day, after finishing up the experiment, we were supposed to wash all the beakers and materials we used. However, some students were having fun mixing the chemicals we used and Mr Ong reminded us not to do so. We were ignorant and did not listen. Mr Ong shocked us when he raised his voice drastically and screamed at us to stop. Only then did the class stopped everything they were doing and paid attention to Mr Ong's lecture on lab safety. This taught us to respect his authority even if he was lenient and to not take advantage of him despite his kindness. It also taught us proper lab safety and was a very imporatnat lesson. The end.
